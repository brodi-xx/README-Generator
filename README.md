# README Generator

## Description

As a developer, you need to have a well written README file for others who didn't work directly on a project. This project is to show and demonstrate my node skills to generator a readme file quickly.

You can see a video of the app in action <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b9FSJHbx5nPgMlFMzRGAzk3CmqvTRh1n/view">here</a>

## Installation

To install the application, you would pull the files from my repo and install node

## Usage

Once you have node running, you will run the app and it prompt you with a series of questions to fill in your README.

## Credits

I referenced freecodecamp.org to see what a good readme file entailed to prompt you with these questions
